## About Me

I’m a software engineer and researcher trained in both law and computer science, now pursuing my M.S. at Northeastern University. My work explores how AI can understand human emotion, respond with care, and create safer digital spaces—especially for people navigating online harm, distress, or vulnerability.

My research combines human–AI interaction, affective computing, and empathetic interface design. I’ve built systems for anonymous reporting, compassionate conversational support during emotionally difficult moments, and natural-language agents for navigating decentralized technologies.

Across all my projects, I’m driven by a simple question:
How can we design AI systems that not only function well, but also support, protect, and empower the people who rely on them?

Let’s build technology with empathy—technology that cares. 🤝
