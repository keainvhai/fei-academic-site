      title: "📚 My Research"
      text: |-
        I’m a Human–Computer Interaction researcher interested in how AI can support psychological safety, emotional well-being, and trustworthy interaction, especially when people face online harm, distress, or vulnerability. 

        My work focuses on designing emotion-aware, empathetic, and privacy-preserving systems that help users feel safe enough to express themselves and seek support. I build and analyze human–AI interactions involving anonymous disclosure, AI-mediated emotional support, and virtual or embodied agents.

        I’m particularly interested in understanding how users experience online harassment, misogynistic language, and emotional overload, and how AI might offer calming, culturally sensitive, or trauma-informed support in these contexts.

        With a background in law and computing, I aim to build ethical, inclusive technologies that empower the most vulnerable.
