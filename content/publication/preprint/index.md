## Abstract

This paper introduces the Doxing Incident Database (DID), a structured repository of real-world doxing incidents.  
By organizing cases with metadata such as victim profile, platform, and incident timeline, the database enables large-scale analysis and helps researchers, policymakers, and journalists understand online harm patterns.
