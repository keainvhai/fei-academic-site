Toxic Escape is an HCI research game designed to explore how players cope with online toxicity.
The game represents harmful online comments as “toxic monsters” that follow the player, prompting them to choose among three coping strategies:

Confront – respond to the monster with skill-based actions that represent direct engagement.

Soothe – activate a breathing shield or calming effect to reduce emotional intensity.

Avoid – reposition or escape to a “safe zone,” representing boundary-setting in digital spaces.

Built in Unity (C#), the game models coping strategies used in digital harm contexts and supports experiments on:

emotional regulation and stress recovery

perceived safety and control

effectiveness of different coping strategies

player behavior and decision-making under pressure

This prototype serves as an embodied, experiential platform for studying online harm, psychological safety, and affective interaction design, and will support future user studies comparing different in-game coping modes.
